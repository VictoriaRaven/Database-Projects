## Information

The Database projects with SQL and written reports in APA reserach format are based on the Relational-Database-Concepts-and-Applications class taken at UMGC. Thses are my projects for class Relational-Database-Concepts-and-Applications and applying them to the Guitar studio/movie store databases. I will not upload other than the project as the rest are part of the course's answer keys. Under the copyright and policies of intellectual property for UMGC, I will only upload items that do not have an answer key and it would mean my projects or assignments that require self-inspired invention. Read all comments in the code.
